# Coinbank 

Coinbank is a private project aimed to help me and my girlfriend to keep track of how much physical money we have saved. Using a Raspberry Pi, a backend server, and a React Native application; we can keep track of our physical spare change digitally and get notified when one of us adds money to the coinjar.

## Features

- Physical Coin Jar connected to a backend server that automatically updates the amount of money saved (only coins).
- A React Native application that allows us to see how much money we have saved.
- Notifications when one of us adds money to the coinjar.
- Robust backend server that can handle multiple requests at the same time.

## Technologies

- Raspberry Pi 3b
- A cheap digital coinjar I found on Amazon
- Node.JS with Express
- Docker
- React Native

## Usage

> Note: This project is currently private and not available for public use. I will update this when the project is finished and leave instructions on how to build your own and host your own private server.
